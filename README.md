- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @FomasTreeman
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in broadening my knowledge within the coding world, i love problem solving 
(fyi project euler is a great site for puzzling the mind with great maths problems)
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to be a full stack web developer, 
hoping to get as comfortable as possible before i move on to studying app(ios and android) development.
- ill always fall back on python for any personal projects, it being easier ;)
